# webring-extension

A firefox extension for surfing the [merveilles webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com) from your browser toolbar. Ideal for idle surfing during pomodoro breaks.

This extension basically adds a button that navigates the current tab to https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random. You could also just create your own live bookmark, but I like having a button with a nice icon.
